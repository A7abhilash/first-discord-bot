# Discord-bot

> My first discord bot.

### Features that I've planned to add:

- [x] User types !mod-me : Bot assigns 'moderator' role to the sender.
- [x] User types "This works great": Bot reacts with an sparkling heart emoji.
- [x] User types "Ping": Bot replies "Pong".
- [x] User deletes any of thier message: Bot replies "Stop deleting messages".

> Join my server: [Nothing much!](https://discord.gg/YKJ7unFP)  
> PS: I've created this server just to learn something new and it's very basic one.
