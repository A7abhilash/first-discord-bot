# Discord-bot

> My first discord bot

### Features that I've planned to add:

- [ ] Greets new users.
- [x] !mod-me : Assigns 'moderator' role to the sender.
- [ ] ?covid-update : Gives the latest covid updates.
- [ ] #joke : Tells a joke to entertain the users.
- [x] This works great: Reacts with an heart emoji if the user sends this message to the channel.

> PS: I've created this server just to learn something new.
